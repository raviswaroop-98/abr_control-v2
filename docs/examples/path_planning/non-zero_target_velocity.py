"""
This script shows an example of planning a path where the final target velocity is
non-zero The path planner will make sure that our path ends at the target position at
the moment it reaches its target velocity.

When planning successive targets with non-zero target velocities between target
positions, need to make sure these points sit along the same line, if possible, to
reduce any jerk in the velocity path. The path planner specifies a path directly from
start to target position, and only warps it to follow the path profile along that
straight line. When starting at a non-zero velocity, that points along a different
direction (which could happen if the previously planned path ended in a non-zero target
velocity), it's necessary to abruptly adjust those components to move in the desired
direction along the target path. The norm of the velocity will still remain smooth, but
the individual components may jump.
